reminders
- loop over mbr entries to check for FAT partition
- fix fat_entry, transmute problem
- why tf does it say std::vec::Vec even when explicitly importing Vec and same with String
- dir.rs fix the last accessed date timestamp to have the current time?
- should you clone the vfat HANDLE when creating new structs?
