Using two threads, write an example that will print different set of results on SC, TSO, and ARM hardware. 
Specify what can be printed on each memory consistency model.

/* Thread 1 */
A = 1; // (1)
print!("{}", B); // (2)

/* Thread 2 */
B = A; // (3)
print!("{}", A); // (4)

Possible outputs for Sequential Consistency(SC):
1-2-3-4: 01
3-4-1-2: 00
1-3-2-4: 11


Possible Outputs for Total Store Ordering(TSO):
1-2-3-4: 00 or 01 depending on when the write propogates to shared memory from the write buffer
1-3-2-4: 11 depending on the write propogation

Possible Outputs for ARM:
The difference with ARM can't be seen with the provided example, but generally ARM provides a weak consistency model with data dependency
