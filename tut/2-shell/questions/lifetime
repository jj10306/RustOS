Why is the bound required?
    The bound is required to ensure that the type T or references that the type T holds live at least as long as 'a.

What could go wrong if the bound wasnâ€™t enforced by Rust?
    The mutable reference with lifetime 'a could possibly outlive the data it refers to; 
    this would lead to a dangling pointer and the possibility of a use-after-free.
