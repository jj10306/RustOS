You might be thinking that the free space we’ve set apart isn’t enough. This is a fair concern. 
One way to answer the question is to look at the file size of kernels from successful operating systems. 
Would they fit?

Determine how large the kernel binary is for the operating system you’re running now. 
On newer versions of macOS, the binary is /System/Library/Kernels/kernel. On older versions of macOS, the binary 
is /mach_kernel. On Linux, the binary is usually located in /boot/ and is named either vmlinuz, vmlinux, or bzImage. 
How big is your kernel’s binary? Would it fit in the 63.5MiB free space we’ve created?

    - The kernel on the VM I am running is 8MiB so it would fit in the space that we've created
