The ReadVolatile and WriteVolatile types make it impossible to write and read, respectively, the underlying pointer. 
How do they accomplish this?
    - They only implement the Readable and Writable triats, repectively, which constrains the underlying pointer to only
    be read or write by exposing the specific functionality through an API that handles the unsafety of volatile read and writes
