Read through the tests we have provided in src/tests.rs. 
Which tests would fail to compile if the Deref implementation did not exist? 
What about the DerefMut implementation? Why?
    - When the Deref trait is unimplemented, it would cause all the tests that have some sort of explicit dereferencing or
    indexing to fail due to the fact that indexing is syntactic sugar *val.index()(index_oob, index_oob_after_truncate, indexing). 
    Similarly, without the DerefMut implementation, the mut_indexing test would fail for similar reasons stated above.
