**You’ll notice that every example we’ve provided wraps the mutable reference in a container and then implements Drop for that container.
What would go wrong if we returned an &mut T directly instead?
    - The reference alread implements the Drop trait so you would not be able to implement drop to unlock when it goes out of scope
