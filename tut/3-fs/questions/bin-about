- I chose powers of two starting at 2^3 because it helped with alignment more than choosing arbitrary numbers and also it is common choice
- My allocator checks the bin that the size most closely fits and then checks the free blocks there to see if they are aligned. I use the util functions we wrote
- Internal: [0, 2^32 - 2^31 + 1], External: technically unbounded because I don't coalesce
