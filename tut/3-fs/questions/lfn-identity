Given the bytes for a directory entry, how, precisely, do you determine whether the entry is an LFN entry or a regular directory entry? 
Be specific about which bytes you read and what their values should be.

    - If the byte at offset 11 of a directory entry is x0F then it is a LFN, otherwise it is a regular directory entry
