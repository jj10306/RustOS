In which situations, if any, will the return value from sleep differ from the input value? In which situations, if any, will they be identical?
 What do you think the relative probability of each case is?
    - When there are processes ahead of it in the queue when its sleep time is up and it still hasn't been polled for the first time. 
    They would be the same when the sleep time has elapsed after or at the first time the poll function is invoked. Additionally, 
    the sleep time has to be a multiple of TICK parameter for it to be a perfect match, thus the likelihood of a perfect match is quite unlikely.
