 What would it mean for two processes to share a stack? 
    - this would mean that the area of memory that each processes' stack build is the same area for both processes
 Why would it be very likely that the processes would crash fairly quickly into their lives? 
    - Because if one process overrode the frame of another process, then the return address of the other process' procedure would 
    be corrupted and thus on return you would most likely return to an invalid region of memory
 Define a property of processes that, even if they were sharing a stack, would never crash as a result of sharing a stack.
    -  Processes could maintain a linked list of frames that make up their section of the stack and then they would need to
        communicate to the other thread where their last use of the stack ended, so the proceess can be sure to not override the other process' stack data
