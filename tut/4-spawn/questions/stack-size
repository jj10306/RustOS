Assuming processes have access to dynamic memory allocation, how could a process increase its stack size? 
Be specific about which instructions the process would execute.
    - The process could allocate a larger block for its stack, copy the previous stack contents over 
    and then update the SP register by putting the new top of the stack in a 
    register via the MOV instruction and then invoke the MSR to move the new top of the stack into SP register
