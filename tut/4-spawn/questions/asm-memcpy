Assuming that the source address is in x0, the destination address is in x1, and the number of bytes to copy is in x2, 
which is guaranteed to be a non-zero multiple of 8, how would you implement memcpy in ARMv8 assembly? Ensure you ret.

memcpy:
    cmp x2, xzr
    beq exit
    ldr x5, [x0], #8
    str x5, [x1], #8
    b memcpy
exit:
    ret
